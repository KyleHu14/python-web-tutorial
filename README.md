## Introduction
The main foundation of this project was written by following a tutorial from Youtube.

I plan to add my own changes and to build onto the base files of the original tutorial.

## List of Changes Implemented
1. Home page shows total number of notes in a user's account 9/4/2021
2. Notes now show the date of when they were added 9/5/2021
